      <h1>North Park</h1>
    <p>
      North Park is a vibrant urban neighborhood and one of the oldest
      neighborhoods in San Diego. In the early 20th c., it was a lemon grove.
      that needed so much water hauled over that a wagon trail was constructed
      from Downtown San Diego - the wagon trail is now Pershing Drive.
      <br /><br />
      Streetcar lines put in in the early 20th c. by the John D. Spreckles
      Electric Railway brought in investors, residents, and shopkeepers. These
      streetcars ran along University Ave. and 30th St., creating what was the
      heart of the North Park back in the early 1900's, as it remains today.
